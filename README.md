# Database Presentation
My first attempt at a beamer presentation, that I'm going to do for a pandaTalk on the database at work. Creating a repository in case I like this, so I can re-use it in the future

## Installation

First you need the beamer theme, so follow the instructions [here](https://www.guidodiepen.nl/2009/04/latex-beamer-diepen-style/) to install the theme.

Then install with pdflatex:

```bash
pdflatex presentation.tex
```

## Future Work

Maybe I'll make a makefile for this or something eventually
